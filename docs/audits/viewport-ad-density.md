# Reduce ad density in initial viewport

## Overview

This audit ensures that visible ads take up no more than 30% of the initial
viewport. An ad density greater than this has been found to negatively impact
user experience[^1].

## Recommendations

Depending on the situation, slots should either be spaced farther apart or have
a reduced size.
